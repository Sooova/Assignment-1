      <h2>Interest in IT:</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          My interest in IT is varied, and has been present for most of my life! From a very young age, I've had access
          to technology such as computers, televisions, gaming consoles and the likes. Pointing to a specific point in
          my life which seriously peaked my interest in IT, was on my 12th birthday, when I received a hand me down
          iphone. Some of the specific interests I have in IT are: video games, web-development, PC building and
          keyboard building; all of which I also have extensive experience in.
        </p>

          My university career path has been an interesting one. Initially, after completing highschool i studied for a
          Bachelor of Science at Melbourne University. After a year of studies there, I was under the impression that it
          was too broad of a university course for me, and shifted to Deakin University studying a Bachelor of
          Biomedical Science. At this point, I continued the course for two and a half years, hoping to see and
          experience a subject, an event or anything at all, that would finally reveal and show my interest in the
          field, however it never arised. As such, I took the plunge and partook in a 6 month coding bootcamp, and from
          then onwards I never looked back! I developed my own project management app, linked to github commits, and
          used this project to apply for jobs all over Melbourne; and was fortunate enough to land a full-time web
          developer role, which I am currently working at. As for why I decided to come to RMIT, was the ability for me
          to study completely online at my own pace, along with RMIT being a well respected university when it comes to
          the Information Technology field.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the main things I hope to achieve during my studies here, is a broader and better understanding of
          concepts which I either have self taught myself, or only received a very brief introduction to during my
          coding bootcamp. Such concepts such as: Sorting Algorithms, programing styles (i.e OOP), networking skills and
          the likes.

      <h2>Ideal Job:</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          My Ideal job prior to the completion of my coding bootcamp was to become a full-stack web developer; and I was
          fortunate enough to have completed this goal of mine late last year. The job listing has since been lifted,
          however i still have the briefing:
        </p>
        <a href = "https://i.imgur.com/Pu0cXKg.png"><p>Link To Briefing</p></a>
        <p>
          Whilst this was a dream come true for me, to acquire a stable job in the field of my interest, I do still have
          ambitions to reach for something greater. My absolute end goal would be to work for a company like google. As
          such, this was a main driving factor for me wanting to go back to university and acquire a degree. The skills
          and qualifications required for my current job were: HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP, all of which I had
          knowledge of prior to applying. Additional skills were learnt on site, such as SFCC and Magento. This skill
          set would also be similar to acquiring a job at google, however another prerequisite would also be having a
          bachelor's degree or higher.

          It is interesting that one of the tests depict me as an auditory person, while the other marks me as a visual
          person. I find this interesting because I found it very difficult to choose between the prompts which
          suggested being auditory or visual. This is because I align with being both an auditory and visual person. In
          my day to day life, I utilize both auditory and visual cues to conduct basic tasks. This also aligns with the
          57% feeling i received on the 16 personalities quiz.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 16 personality test, it depicts me as a confident individualist. I do find this accurate, whilst I tend
          to follow guidelines and orders given in the workplace, it isnâ€™t uncommon for me to form and base an opinion
          of mine on the work I do. As such, in the work I do, I may sometimes feel the way I complete something is,
          whilst not necessarily the only way to do it, but maybe a more correct way of doing things. However this is
          offset by my 53% introvertedness which leads me to ultimately agree with other people, even if I think my
          solution or opinion is the correct way of doing things.
        </p>
        <p>
          As mentioned above, I should take this information and not let my opinions form too strong of a bias in the
          work i do, whilst at the same time should also not let my introvertedness stop me from depicting what i think
          to be correct.

      <h2>Project Idea:</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          The project idea that I would like to complete is to create a mock high-end fashion company website, using
          current web development and web design trends. I would like the project to be hosted using heroku and purchase
          a mock domain name. The motivation for this idea came from me frequently browsing and being in awe of the cool
          animation, design trends and complex css grid and flexbox layouts that fashion companies are able to bring to
          life. I have dabbled in it myself a few times, one of which can be seen here (homepage and blog-page are all
          that works)
          </p>
          <p>
          https://sooova.github.io/Validus-Studios-Concept/
          </p>
          <p>
          When making the above website, everything was
          done statically. There is no backend, no database and no templating; it was more a test to see if my design
          and front-end skills were up to speed. As such, the project that i would like to create will be as follows: I
          would like it to be a full-stack application utilizing a database, javascript front-end library, either
          mongoDB or mysql database and various other front-end javascript libraries to help with animation handling.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
          More specifically, I would like the website to have a homepage, product listing page, product display page,
          about us page, cart page, blog page. As this project will be for demo purposes only, i will implement a demo
          stripe payment gateway and will not use a headless ecommerce backend such as shopify or magento commerce.</p><p> On
          the homepage, I would like to use current web design and web development trends, such as animations, mixed in
          with monotone colors. On the product listing and display page, I would like to aim for a design similar to the
          likes of Zara, Glassons and louis vutton, who all incorporate similar aspects to their website. The main goal
          of this website is to flesh out my front-end capabilities, which was the main goal of my previous attempt, but
          to also improve my backend skills. I would also like to shoot for an above 90% score on all categories on
          google lighthouse SEO. If possible, I would like to also take my own photos for the products on the page.</p><p> In
          terms of the technologies that will need to be used, they likely will be the following: Next.Js + react.Js for
          front-end. MongoDB or Mysql for databases. Heroku for deployment. Node.js. GraphQL and Apollo server for API
          queries. The skills required will be: HTML, CSS, Javascript as well as either SQL. On top of this, I will have
          to deal with aliases and CNAMES for website domain hosting, and figma for initial design prototypes. All of
          these skills I already have in some capacity, and as such this project should be very doable given enough time
          and effort.</p><p> Pending a successful project, I will have been able to make a full-stack application from the
          ground-up, using modern design and web development trends. As such, it will further my skills and capabilities
          as a full-stack developer, whilst also providing a worthy portfolio piece for the future.</p>
